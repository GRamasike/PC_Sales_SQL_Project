# 💻 PC Sales SQL Project
## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on exploring and analysing a **PC Sales dataset** using SQL Server. The dataset contains sales records from a retail PC business operating across multiple continents, countries, and sales channels.

The goal of this project is to answer **30 analytical business questions** using SQL — progressing from basic data exploration through to advanced window functions and profitability analysis.

## 📁 Database Setup

```sql
CREATE DATABASE PC_Sales;
USE PC_Sales;
```

**Main table:** `pc_data` — 10,000 rows of PC sales records

## 📂 Repository Structure

The 30 queries are split across three files, organised by difficulty level to show progression in SQL complexity:

| File | Level | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `PCSales_Foundations.sql` | 🟢 Beginner | Basic SELECT, COUNT, and filtering queries |
| `PCSales_Exploration.sql` | 🟡 Intermediate | Revenue, profit, and aggregation by category |
| `PCSales_Analysis.sql` | 🔴 Advanced | Profit margins, rankings, date functions, and window functions |

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

Use **SQL queries** to explore, filter, and analyse the dataset. This project focuses on:

- Extracting meaningful business insights from retail sales data
- Translating business questions into structured SQL queries
- Demonstrating progression from foundational to advanced SQL concepts

---

## 🔍 Key SQL Skills Demonstrated

- Basic `SELECT` queries & column aliasing
- `WHERE` filtering & multi-condition logic
- `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MAX`, `MIN` aggregations
- `GROUP BY` for grouped analysis
- Calculated fields — profit, profit margin, days to ship
- `DATEDIFF` and `TRY_CONVERT` for date calculations
- `TOP` for ranking results
- **Window functions** — `RANK()` for ranking sales performance
